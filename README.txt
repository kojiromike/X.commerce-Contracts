DEVELOPERS:

If you will be adding a new domain contract, please be sure to include it as
a module in the pom.xml file in this root directory.

The 'all' project has a dependency on all domain contracts.  It serves
as a single artifact that our tools can use to get access to all 
domain contracts.  Please also add a dependency in all/pom.xml as well
if you are introducing a new domain.
