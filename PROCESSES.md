If you will be adding a new domain contract, please be sure to include it as a module in the pom.xml file in this root directory.

The 'all' project has a dependency on all domain contracts.  It serves as a single artifact that our tools can use to get access to all domain contracts. Please also add a dependency in all/pom.xml as well if you are introducing a new domain.

For a detailed description of the individual domain contracts, please refer to our [externally accessible wiki site](https://xcommerce-open-commerce-language.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GENERAL/Start+Here).

If you need to log an issue related to our current contract definition, please contact [Anand Gangadharan](mailto:anand@x.com)
